# Hey!
My name is Joshua and I'm studying Computer Science at the Florida Institute of Technology (B.S. 2022-2025). My fields of interest are software architecture & design, networking, federated learning, and distributed & parallel computing.

## My Work

- 🔒 **[`pypiactl`](https://github.com/LumaDevelopment/pypiactl)**, a wrapper for the command-line interface to the Private Internet Access (PIA) client.
- 📱 **STREAM API**, a multi-protocol, extensible, mobile ad-hoc networking library for Android. *A [CADAS](https://cadas.fit.edu/) project, sponsored by AFRL/RYAA.*
- 🌊 **[Receding Coastlines](https://github.com/YashedP/Shellhacks-2025/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#backend)**, a platform which allows you to visualize the impact rising sea levels will have on Florida's eastern coast.
- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence**, materials from the [regular](https://github.com/LumaDevelopment/ArtificialIntelligence) and [advanced](https://github.com/LumaDevelopment/AdvancedTopicsInAI) Artifical Intelligence courses at the Florida Institute of Technology.
- 🎲 **[Velox](https://github.com/LumaDevelopment/Velox)**, a speed-oriented math game from Android where you speak your answer!
- 🏆 **Competitions**, check out my solutions to some of the programming competitions I've participated in: [EFSC Hacker's Cup 2021](https://github.com/LumaDevelopment/efsc-hackers-cup-2021), [Intercollegiate Programming Competition 2021](https://github.com/LumaDevelopment/intercollegiate-programming-competition-2021)
- 👾 **Cyber**, check out the [CTF I made](https://github.com/LumaDevelopment/SapphireCTF) and [my solutions](https://github.com/LumaDevelopment/neverlanctf-2019-writeups) to one of the CTFs I've participated in!
- 🎯 **Redsky**, check out [my writeup](https://gist.github.com/LumaDevelopment/f2a34a202fed6ab5a7f3a31282834943) on how I reverse engineered Target's distribution backend!
